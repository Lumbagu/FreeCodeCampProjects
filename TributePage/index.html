                <p style="text-align: justify;" class="padbot">Squishy started his Rocket League career when he realized
                    he could not follow a professional soccer career. <i>"Going pro in football/soccer is something that
                        I always wanted to do. [...] Growing up you see so many kids wanting to go pro in that, right?
                        And it just seems impossible..."</i> But that was not the only problem. In his early days he was
                    diagnosed with asthma, which didn't allow him to run for long periods of time.
                    <br><br>
                    Squishy started playing in Rocket League’s beta phase in 2015. <i>"Rocket League gave me a concept I
                        loved and allowed me a second chance at a dream I couldn’t be held back from this time."</i>
                    Within a month of the game's release he started uploading videos of Rocket League on his YouTube
                    channel, where he posted back his highlight goals. He quickly started improving and was outstanding
                    despite not having a background in SARPBC, Rocket League's predecessor.
